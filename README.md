# Shopperz

As a tech enthusiast, I created Shopperz, a MERN web application that serves as a mock e-commerce platform for users to purchase various Apple devices. 
Through building this project, I learned how to create a REST API with Node.js and MongoDB to authenticate users with JSON Web Tokens. In addition, I worked with the Stripe API to automate payments and Postman for API testing purposes.
On the frontend, Shopperz uses React and Redux, with Bootstrap and Styled Components for styling.
